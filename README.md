# OSCP
OSCP - Study

- As I continue to update this repo use the [References](https://github.com/In3x0rabl3/OSCP/blob/main/Awesome-references.md). 

- Literally everything you need to pass the OSCP is on those two sites.

- Inside [bof](https://github.com/In3x0rabl3/OSCP/tree/main/bof) you will find everything you need for a basic overflow w/o protections. I used python3 and the library pwntools, to make life a little easier. Enjoy.
